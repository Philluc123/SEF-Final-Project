This web-based conversion calculator was developed as a project for my software fundamentals course, providing a practical application of core concepts. Prior to beginning development, we engaged in thorough planning, selecting an appropriate development model and creating detailed documentation. This included the construction of class and sequence diagrams to map out the application's architecture and behavior, as well as the formulation of user stories to ensure the project met the intended user needs. The calculator encompasses unit conversions for distance, mass, and temperature, alongside a basic calculator and material cost estimation tool.

## Features

* **Unit Conversions:**
    * Distance (meters, kilometers, feet, miles)
    * Mass (kilograms, grams, pounds, ounces)
    * Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
* **Basic Calculator:** Perform simple arithmetic calculations.
* **Material Cost Estimation:** Calculate the total cost of materials based on quantity and cost per unit.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Not Currently Functional
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and use.

## Getting Started

To use the Conversion Calculator+, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Or run index.html as a live server

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd [project directory]
    ```

3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  Select the desired conversion type from the sidebar (Distance, Mass, Temperature, Calculator, Material Cost).
2.  Enter the value to be converted or calculated.
3.  Select the input and output units (for conversions).
4.  Click the "Convert" or "Calculate" button.
5.  The result will be displayed below the form.
6.  Use the language selection dropdown in the header to change the language.

## Project Structure

* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the application logic.
* `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
* `assets/`: Contains image assets used in the application.



## Planned Improvements

* Expand language support.
* Add more unit conversion options.
* Improve the calculator's functionality.
* Refine the user interface and user experience.
